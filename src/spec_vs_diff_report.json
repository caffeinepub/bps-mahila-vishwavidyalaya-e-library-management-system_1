  "summary": "Diff adds a non-admin guidance alert on the User Dashboard, but does not show the requested backend recovery bootstrapping method nor the frontend hash-token extraction/sessionStorage + post-login bootstrapping call/invalidation flow.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add a backend recovery/bootstrapping update method that lets the authenticated caller become Admin using the existing bootstrap secret only when no admin exists yet, with explicit errors for already-initialized or invalid/missing secret, implemented in backend/main.mo.",
      "reason": "The provided backend/main.mo diff portion shows existing profile/role logic but does not include any new shared(update) recovery/bootstrap method or the required error handling semantics. Because the backend diff is truncated, it is not possible to verify that the required method exists.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo (truncated)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement frontend flow to read `caffeineAdminToken` from URL hash via existing urlParams utilities, persist to sessionStorage, call backend bootstrapping method after Internet Identity login, invalidate/refresh React Query so `useIsCallerAdmin()` updates, show non-crashing English errors on failure, and clear token from address bar after extraction.",
      "reason": "No changes are shown to URL hash parsing utilities, no sessionStorage persistence is evidenced, and no post-login bootstrapping call/invalidation or error messaging flow is present in the shown modified frontend files. App.tsx only sets up routing/layout and UserDashboardPage only adds guidance text.",
